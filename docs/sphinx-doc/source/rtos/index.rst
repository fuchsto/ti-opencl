OpenCL on TI-RTOS
###################

Previous chapters described TI OpenCL runtime on the platforms whose hosts
are running Linux.  We extended TI OpenCL offering to platforms whose hosts
are running TI-RTOS, TI's real time operating system.  In this chapter,
we describe the OpenCL RTOS package, show how to run examples, and discuss
the process of developing OpenCL application with OpenCL RTOS package.

Initially Supported Platform: AM572x (since OpenCL TI Product Version
v01.01.09.1)
