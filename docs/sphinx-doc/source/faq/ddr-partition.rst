How do I allocate more DDR memory for OpenCL use?
******************************************************

If your application needs more OpenCL global memory than the system default,
you can modify the device tree files to increase the size of the CMEM block
partitioned for OpenCL use.  Please see
:ref:`CHANGE_DDR3_PARTITION_FOR_OPENCL` for details.
